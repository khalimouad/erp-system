3. **Performance Issues**: System may not perform well with large data volumes
   - **Mitigation**: Early performance testing, database optimization, scalable architecture

4. **Resource Constraints**: Development resources may be limited
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize features, consider phased deployment, adjust timeline if necessary

## Success Criteria

1. System complies with all Moroccan regulatory requirements
2. All modules are fully integrated and working together seamlessly
3. System performs well with expected data volumes
4. User interface is available in French, Arabic, and English
5. Documentation is comprehensive and user-friendly
6. System passes all security audits

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to completing the PRISM ERP system. By following this plan, the development team can ensure that all components are implemented in a logical order, with proper attention to dependencies and priorities. Regular reviews of progress against this roadmap will help identify any issues early and allow for adjustments as needed.
